Python code of a novel algorithm to solve the Kantorovich Mass Transport Problem via Wavelet Theory and Multiresolution Analysis. In the python file, it has been set the wavelet Coiflet1, it can be changed whitout any problem. The mathematics behind this code can be read in “A computational efficient algorithm for optimal mass transport via waveled-based multiresolution methods”, published in the event CIAPP 2025.
